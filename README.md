# **The Problem**
Local musicians looking to record or producer music. 

# **The Purpose of the Site**
The purpose of this site is for aspiring artists to go to this music producer, Ehsan, who can help producer their music. This site will show the rates per hour spent renting out a booth to producer one’s music. It will also show the contact information and the location of his business. There will be some demo songs that have been recorded at Ehsan’s production studio. This site will give the artist an idea of how much it would cost them if they were to work with Ehsan. Also, it will give them an idea of what type of music he produces so the artist can make their final decisions to work with him or not.
This website is meant to look simple yet also show the experience a music producer would have making a website which is very little. We wanted to be able to book an appointment so on the contact page there is a link that leads to a schedule. Also, we wanted some sample music that we could show. This is on the examples page and with more experience we could make it look even better using javascript. We also wanted a tab showing and listing everything Ehsan has in his studio. 

# **Audience**
The audience that would be using this site is mostly teenagers and younger demographic age group(18-28). Both genders but mostly males. The artists are probably going to be looking for a cheaper place to produce their music since they probably work a lot and don’t make much money. They would be usually from a smaller town that is looking to “make it big”. The personality is someone who has a lot of friends but maybe shy about their music. Usually someone in a really rural town or very urban city. They want to be noticed and stand out from the rest.

# **Preliminary Mockup/Axure**
The font choice for this web page would look modern or very “techy”. For example: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rajdhani, https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis .These font looks modern but are still easy to read which is what we want the page to look like. As for the color we might do like black and white or earthy tones like a green to represent that modern, “techy” feel. For example: This color palette is really nice because it’s not dark and it still gives off the modern vibe. Also, we wanted our favicon to have the colors and modern font to match.

# **Conclusion**
In conclusion, we found that our website was pretty basic and there were a lot of things we could have changed. But for a freelance music producer this website does reflect the experience they would have making a website. For the size of the photos we were pretty restricted since they were really blurry on our phone. The website navigation overall was pretty easy to follow according to the information from our usability testing. Little details like the color on the “rollover” effect in the navigation was changed as well as the underline that was originally there. I think if we had more time and were more experienced as a group we could improve the site even more. This was a great project and easy to follow the group worked together to make this understandable for all of us to code together. 

# **Usability Testing Notes**
- First Notes - 
  - Easily found the examples page and was easily able to play the music
  - Was able to find the contact page and able to get to where you can book an appointment
  - Found the rates tab but wallet had a small heart attack when seeing the prices
  - Showing the student discount could be a good idea
  - About tab looks a little barren (could add a little to it) but it works
  - Examples could get some sort of label to be able to let people know what each track is
  - Could get some more images overall and possibly find a real studio :shrug: and maybe take photos with a real camera :shrug:
  - Possibly could rearrange the tabs to make more sense for what a consumer would look at each time
- Second Notes – 
  - Again was easily able to find the examples and play pieces of music
  - All tracks play over each other if not paused
  - Found the chart for booking a time slot
  - Found the rates section with ease when prompted to
  - Possibly take the underlines off of our tabs
  - Add pictures with the examples
