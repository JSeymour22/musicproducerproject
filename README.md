# **The Problem**
Local musicians looking to record or producer music. 

# **The Purpose of the Site**
The purpose of this site is for aspiring artists to go to this music producer, Ehsan, who can help producer their music. This site will show the rates per hour spent renting out a booth to producer one’s music. It will also show the contact information and the location of his business. There will be some demo songs that have been recorded at Ehsan’s production studio. This site will give the artist an idea of how much it would cost them if they were to work with Ehsan. Also, it will give them an idea of what type of music he produces so the artist can make their final decisions to work with him or not.
This website is meant to look simple yet also show the experience a music producer would have making a website which is very little. We wanted to be able to book an appointment so on the contact page there is a link that leads to a schedule. Also, we wanted some sample music that we could show. This is on the examples page and with more experience we could make it look even better using javascript. We also wanted a tab showing and listing everything Ehsan has in his studio.
